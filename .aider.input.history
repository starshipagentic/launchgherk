+the mission is going to be  very high level, and not in the format that you gave an example of.  show me what we can do to change the mission.md into the starting point, such as "typical ecommerce shopping cart".  
+
+we need to add llm, which we will choose this exact python code:
+```
+import ollama
+response = ollama.generate(model='llama3.2', prompt=prompt)        
+summary = response['response']
+```
+that way we can use llm natural language to go from each step.
+
+also, the current code, it has the exact same info in mission.md, stories.md, dsl.md etc.  we need to have the progressive value add that language llm models bring for each step or they are redundant.
+
+also, instead of having dsl folder and a stories folder and a mission folder.  just have one folder called launchpad, and put all those files in one place, with the exception that /features folder still gets the features.
+
+also, name each file to start with the type, like dsl.somename.yaml (and it ends in .yaml so my ide will show colors, and starts with dsl.something so that multiples of those files stay together. ). same with mission.md, just call it mission.md and it will be obvious.  and stories.yaml and pipeline.log and tracibility.json etc are all self evident.

+actually, keep a timestamp, and if the file exists and hasn't been modified, then skip.  but if you see a file has been modified, then you can assume steps need to be redone.  for instance, if my mission.md file hasn't been touched, and you have the story.yaml, then you don't need mission->story  but if mission was edited, then you'd assume story.yaml isn't up to date and do that step of mission->story and then other next steps on down in the pipeline
